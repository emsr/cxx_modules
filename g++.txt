Pasted from the modules branch man pages:

       -fmodules
       -fmodules++
           Enable experimental support for the Extensions to C++ for Modules extension.

       -fmodule-root=dir
           Option not fully baked.

       -fmodule-path=dir
           Append dir to the compiled module interface search path. The ':' separated directory list in
           CXX_MODULE_PATH is appended after explicitly specified directories.

       -fmodule-wrapper=program
           If a compiled module interface file cannot be found on the module path, this program is invoked
           to build it.  After completion, the module path is re-searched.  If not specified, the value of
           CXX_MODULE_WRAPPER shall be used, which if not specified will default to a built-in wrapper
           program.  The values of COLLECT_GCC and COLLECT_GCC_OPTIONS can be used to determine the compiler
           command and compilation options.

       -fmodule-output=file
           Write the binary module interface into file.  This option is only valid when compiling a module
           interface unit.

       -fmodule-file=[name=]file
           If the name=file form is used, then the binary interface for module name is in file.  If the file
           form is used, then read mappings of either form, one per line, from file.  When reading mappings
           from a file, unless an absolute path is used, the mapping files are relative to the file being
           read from.

       -fdump-lang
           Dump language-specific information.  The file name is made by appending .lang to the source file
           name.  Currently used for C++ modules.

       -fdump-lang-all
       -fdump-lang-switch
       -fdump-lang-switch-options
       -fdump-lang-switch-options=filename
           Control the dumping of language-specific information.  The options and filename portions behave
           as described in the -fdump-tree option.  The following switch values are accepted:

           all Enable all language-specific dumps.

           class
               Dump class hierarchy information.  Virtual table information is emitted unless 'slim' is
               specified.  This option is applicable to C++ only.

           module
               Dump module information.  This option is applicable to C++ only.

           raw Dump the raw internal tree data.  This option is applicable to C++ only.
